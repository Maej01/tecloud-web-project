His mother worked as a seamstress in the Fashion District and brought home scrap materials for Jesse to create his early mixed media art. From that point on, Jesse became hooked on creating art from scrap metals, fabrics, wood, canvas, and many others. During his junior year at Bischon Art School in Los Angeles, he perfected his own proprietary method of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze, which he will demonstrate on Monday in his session, 'Art in Full Bloom'.",
